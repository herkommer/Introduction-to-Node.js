# Introduction to Node.js
# Getting started
Welcome to this *Introduction to Node.js* course. Before we begin you need to install and familiarize yourself with the tools we’re are going to use throughout this course.
##Install tools

### Node.js <img src="https://microservicebus.blob.core.windows.net/sample/nodejs-256.png" alt="Node.js"/>
Browse to https://nodejs.org and download and install the latest version of Node.js. Once installed, you should be able to run Node by opening a command prompt/terminal and type **“node”**. You are now in node, and can start typing JavaScript! Try typing **“console.log('Hello from Node.js')”** to verify it works. You can exit by closing the terminal or by hitting **CTRL+C**.

### Visual Studio Code <img src="https://microservicebus.blob.core.windows.net/sample/svcode.png" alt="VS Code"/>

Proceed by installing Visual Studio Code, which you can download from https://code.visualstudio.com/download. 
After completed, familiarize yourself with some of the [basics](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics).

### Chrome and Postman <img src="https://microservicebus.blob.core.windows.net/sample/postman.png" alt="Postman"/>

In some of the labs, we’re going to build Web API’s, and **Postman** is an excellent tool to use for testing those services. Postman is a Chrome extension and can be installed by opening Chrome and navigate to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en-US.

### MongoDB <img src="https://microservicebus.blob.core.windows.net/sample/mongo.png" alt="Postman"/>

MongoDB is one of the most commonly used databases for Node.js and in some of the labs we're going to use it. Download the community edition from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs&_ga=1.150965301.2000935923.1474745557#community]). Install it with complete options if asked.

### Git <img src="https://microservicebus.blob.core.windows.net/sample/git.png" alt="Git"/>
Git is a version control system that is used for software development and other version control tasks. Git is not strictly necessary, but every developer with pride should have it installed. 

The Git client for Windows can be installed [here]( https://git-scm.com/download/win). If you are a Mac user you can download it [here]( https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

### microServicebus.com <img src="https://microservicebus.blob.core.windows.net/sample/msb.png" alt="microServiceBus"/>

The tutorial includes one lab on IoT (Internet Of Things), where you’ll be using [microServiceBus.com]( https://microServiceBus.com). To speed things up, prepare yourself by creating and account and organization if you don’t already have one.
